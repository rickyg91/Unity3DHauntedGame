# John Lemons Haunted House: 3D
## Built with Unity

My first 3D game I have every created with Unity, and I have included all the C# scripts that I used for: 
- Controlling the game 
- Player movements 
- Enemy waypoints etc.

All the 3D models can be downloaded from the Unity Asset store by searching, "John Lemons 3D Haunt".
